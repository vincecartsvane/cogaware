from django.db import models

"""
The models in this class are a Python interface to SQL tables in a database.
The tables are created by running the following steps:
- REQUIRED:
  python manage.py makemigrations distortions (creates a Python file in the migrations directory which outlines the series of steps required for the database to match the models)
- OPTIONAL (shows the SQL generated from the new migration):
  python manage.py sqlmigrate distortions <migrationnumber>, where
<migrationnumber> is the number from the file of the most recent migration
created by makemigrations, e.g. '0001' from 0001_initial.py
- OPTIONAL (to ensure the migration won't break anything):
  python manage.py check
- REQUIRED:
  python manage.py migrate (actually applies the migration to the database)
